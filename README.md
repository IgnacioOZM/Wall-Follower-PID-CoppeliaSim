# Wall-Follower-PID-CoppeliaSim
This project will focus on the creation of a wall follower algorithm to control the robot pioneer p3dx.
The objective is to enable the robot to explore its surroundings while avoiding obstacles and walls.
* Use the CoppeliaSim Python Remote API.
* Acquire sensor readings and issue commands to control a differential drive robot.
* Program a wall-following algorithm to explore a corridor environment.
